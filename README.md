# Live-Resume

### 18hrs of Code so-far
Didn't expect it to take this long.

When project is read for deployment, it should:
> 1. Take User data and convert to a beautified & formatted Resume/CV in pdf
> 2. Offer atleast 1-2 templates to choose
> 3. Basic formatting change allowed
> 4. Should allow user to get a WEBPAGE also that can be deployed

### Current Stage:
> 1. Backend -> Tested using MongoDB and Postman.
> 2. Frontend -> Work-in-progress. Code needs to be cleaned up and refactored.
> 3. Docker -> TBA once frontend is upto scratch.

### TODO:
> 1. Refactor components
> 2. Test Frontend
> 3. Switch to Jenkins for testing
> 5. Prepare HTML template(s)
> 4. Dockerise
> 6. Beautify and cleanup
